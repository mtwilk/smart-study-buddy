// USAGE EXAMPLES
// ============================================================================

/*

EXAMPLE 1: Generate a "define" question

const exercise = await generateTier2Exercise(
  "short_answer_define",
  "Recursion",
  2,
  "practical",
  openaiClient
);

await Exercise.create(exercise);


EXAMPLE 2: Evaluate a definition (keyword-based, no GPT)

const evaluation = await evaluateTier2Exercise(
  exercise,
  { answer: "Recursion is when a function calls itself with a base case to stop." }
);

// Returns:
{
  isCorrect: true,
  score: 100,
  feedback: "Good! You covered the key points: function, calls itself, base case",
  keyPointsCovered: ["function", "calls itself", "base case"],
  keyPointsMissed: []
}


EXAMPLE 3: Evaluate an explanation (GPT-assisted)

const explainExercise = await generateTier2Exercise(
  "short_answer_explain",
  "Binary Search",
  3,
  "hybrid",
  openaiClient
);

const evaluation = await evaluateTier2Exercise(
  explainExercise,
  { answer: "Binary search works by repeatedly dividing the search space in half..." },
  openaiClient // GPT required for this type
);


EXAMPLE 4: Problem type recognition

const recognition = await generateTier2Exercise(
  "problem_type_recognition",
  "Calculus",
  2,
  "practical",
  openaiClient
);

const evaluation = await evaluateTier2Exercise(
  recognition,
  { answer: "Power Rule" }
);


EXAMPLE 5: Concept comparison (GPT-assisted)

const comparison = await generateTier2Exercise(
  "concept_comparison",
  "Data Structures",
  4,
  "hybrid",
  openaiClient
);

const evaluation = await evaluateTier2Exercise(
  comparison,
  { answer: "Arrays have O(1) access but O(n) insertion, while linked lists..." },
  openaiClient
);
